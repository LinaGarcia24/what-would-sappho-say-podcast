<h2>Testing</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari</li>
<li>I confirmed that this project is responsive on different size standard screens by using the measurements listed in Am I responsive and by using the devtools</li>
<li>I have confirmed that every internal link works and that every external link opens in a new tab or in the appropiate application (mobile) and does not take the user out of the page</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<h4>Solved Bugs</h4>
<ul>
<li>When I checked the responsive design of my site with the media queries I had created on http://ami.responsivedesign.is/, I realized that not only was the site not responsive to the dimensions the Am I Responsive site uses but that additional space could be found at the right hand side of the page and the user could move the page side to side</li>
<li>I fixed the horizontal scroll by hidding the overflow in CSS by adding overflow-x: hidden; to the body element and the responsive issues by focusing on media queries that targeted the dimensions used by the Am I Responsive site instead of attempting to generalize the code</li>
</ul>

<h4>Validator Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li>HTML
    <ul>
    <li>One error was returned when passing through the official W3C validator the first time: <em>The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.</em> This was part of the youtube code that was used to embed the intro youtube video. I fixed the issue by deleting the frameborder attribute from the code entirely</li>
    <li>No errors were returned when passing the code through the official W3C validator a second time</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>CSS
<ul>
    <li>No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Accessibility
<ul>
    <li>I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools</li>
