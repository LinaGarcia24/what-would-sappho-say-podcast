            <p>Hi, everyone! I am currently on a mission of reviewing all the Sapphic literature that I can find. The
                content that I have will inform you of all the positives and negatives that surround each of the books
                that I review, so you can decide which ones are the best for you.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ali, I am 25 and from County Kildare in Ireland.
                About a year ago during the first lockdown in Ireland, I managed to read 26 books and in doing so I made
                many discoveries about the type of books that I read. The main point being that I had never read a
                single book that had any queer character main or otherwise. As a gay woman, this made me feel a little
                like I was letting the LGBTQ+ community, it’s creators and authors down. So I made it my mission to beat
                my number of 26 books by reading only sapphic novels, books that centered around queer women, women who
                love women etc. In making this decision I had to make sure I spent my money in the right places,
                unfortunately for me though, there was not a lot of information out there that pointed me in the right
                direction so some of the books that I bought and read, were in my opinion, not worth it, with some of
                them being borderline offensive. From this point onwards, I decided that the LGBTQ+, or the Sapphic
                community to be specific, needed to be informed on what books were out there and what they contained so
                that we can all make the right decisions when it comes to spending money on books and find the right
                representation for you.
                <br>
                When I’m not reading, reviewing or recording (The three R’s that have become the centre of my life) you
                can find me playing video games, drawing, painting or watching Imagine Me & You for the umpteenth time!
                <br>
                I hope that this journey I am on with Sapphic books, helps even a handful of you to find the books that
                give you comfort, joy and a sense of being seen. I also hope that by doing this we can change the way
                Sapphics are represented in the media and literature even in a small way.
